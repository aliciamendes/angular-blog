      'Over the past year we’ve been evolving Angular based on developer feedback and community trends. We receive developer feedback from dozens of sources including GitHub, social media, interviews, conferences, etc. One of the strongest guiding indicators which has been highly influential in our prioritization process are the results from the Angular developer survey.In 2023 we delivered a lot to address developers needs for higher performance and better developer experience. Just to mention a few improvements: to make Angular more enjoyable to use, we shipped a brand new build pipeline that improves build speeds with up to 87%, revamped Angular’s reactivity system with Signals, and delivered deferrable views to help you make your apps faster.',

    desciption:
      'The Angular community has asked for an intuitive, built-in method to lazy load components, directives, and pipes. In Angular v17, we’ve created Deferrable Views, a new feature that will make the process of defer loading dependencies significantly more intuitive. We built the deferrable views feature alongside the new control flow syntax using the same “@-syntax”. Our goal is for it to be ergonomic and familiar when using this new syntax in your component templates',
